            One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers
            sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay,
            watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide
            chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were
            papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds
            and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
